# Calcuation Tools (various)

Written in vanilla JavaScript (well, exception see below) for the pure joy of it.

Calculate percentages, your lifetime (in hours, minutes, seconds), your chinese zodiac sign and - the feature you've been longing for - convert a string to morse code.
I'll keep adding converters and stuff whenever I find the time to churn out new stuff.

Exception: Using jquery UI as a polyfill for <input type="date"> since browser support is still flimsy.

Attention: This stuff does not even have basic error capture, no time, sorry! (thus the stuff here is not intended for the average user, use with caution or add your own measures (advised!)
